    <h2>A good one to impress!</h2>
      <p>This recipe from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/85389/gourmet-mushroom-risotto/">allrecipes</a> takes a bit of time, but it's well worth your patience and a perfectly good excuse to open a bottle of nice white wine. This is so good on its own, beefed up with mushrooms and some grated parm on top, or can accompany a nice piece of salmon, shrimp or meat of choice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6 C chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 T olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 C Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 C dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 T butter</li>
        <li>3 T chives, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/3 C parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li>salt & Pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
   
    <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
